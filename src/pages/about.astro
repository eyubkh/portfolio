    I am a self-taught student with a goal of becoming a software engineer. My strong interest in computer science drives me to constantly improve my skills and knowledge through self-study and staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and programming languages. I am highly motivated and dedicated to achieving success in this field.

   <Title text="about me" />
   <p>I am living in the United Kingdom, but I was born in Spain and have family from Morocco , so I have a diverse cultural background. I've always felt that I don't really belong to any one specific place, and that's why I love traveling and learning about other cultures.</p>
   <p class="my-3">I also enjoy staying active and do sport at the gym regularly. I find it not only keeps me physically fit, but it also helps me to clear my mind and reduce stress. In my free time, I also love being outside and spending time in nature.</p>
